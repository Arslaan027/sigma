                What is the difference in liability protection between a Private

                A Private Limited Company offers limited liability protection,
                meaning that the personal assets of its owners are protected
                from business debts and liabilities. In contrast, a
                Proprietorship Firm does not offer liability protection; the
                owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the
                business.
