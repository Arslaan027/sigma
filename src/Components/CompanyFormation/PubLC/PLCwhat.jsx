              A Private Limited Company is a business entity privately owned by
              shareholders. It is distinct from its shareholders and offers
              limited liability, meaning the shareholders’ personal assets are
              protected. The ownership of this company is restricted, as shares
              are not publicly traded, and new shares can only be issued with
              the approval of the existing shareholders. It is commonly used for
              small and medium-sized businesses in India.
