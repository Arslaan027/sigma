            Registering your company as an OPC is an excellent choice for a
            small business structure. However, if you intend to expand it to
            <br />
            higher levels, this may not work. The total number of persons in an
            OPC is always one. You cannot add more members or <br />{" "}
            shareholders, which can stifle corporate expansion and growth.

            One Person Company is not permitted to engage in non-banking
            financial investment operations under the rules and regulations.
            Registering as an OPC does not provide you the freedom to invest in
