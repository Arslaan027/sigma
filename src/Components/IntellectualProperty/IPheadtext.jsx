        legally protected from unauthorized use by others. These creations can
        include inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols,
        names, and images used in commerce. IP rights give creators and
        inventors exclusive control over their intellectual assets, allowing
        them to benefit from their work. The main types of intellectual property
        include:
